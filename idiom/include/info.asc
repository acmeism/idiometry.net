include
=======

NAME
----

include - Include a library by name

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Often known as `require`, `import` or `use`, this concept is to read and eval
a code library file into memory.

DISCUSSION
----------

Most programming languages have a way to load a named concept, known here as a
library. Typically the name is turned into a file system concept then the file
system is searched according to some set of rules. If found, the file is read
and evaluated, typically in relation to the scope in which it was included.

Typically at least one symbol is added to the scope during a successful
include. The new symbols offer accessibility to the concepts encoded by the
library.

While the include concept is common across programming languages, the exact
behaviour and side effects differ quite a bit. The purpose of this idiom is
just to include a library, but language specific details should be discussed.
