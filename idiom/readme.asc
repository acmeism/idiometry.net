NAMING
------

Each idiom has a directory with a short name consisting of lowercase letters,
numbers and dash characters. The names are meant to be short, somewhat
meaningful, fairly rememerable monikers for the idioms. The full information of
what they mean is described within their directory.

It is not yet clear how granular the topics will be. That will be sorted out
over time. For starters, the rule should roughly be, as small as to be
non-trivial. Use your best judgement.
