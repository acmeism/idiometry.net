idiometry.net
============

Introduction
------------

Idiometry is a collection of programming idioms expressed in several different
programming languages.

The data in this repository is used to build http://www.idiometry.net (coming
soon), a programming language educational site aimed at helping people learn
new languages, idiom by idiom.

Design
------

The main idea guiding how this repository is laid out, is to express as much
information, in a very consistent manner, with as little data and duplication
as possible.

The data can then be used to build a rich and dynamic content viewing system.
